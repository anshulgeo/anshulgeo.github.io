I am a human geographer working at the intersection of urban studies, political economy, and development geography theory. My research examines displacement, land, and urban redevelopment in Global South. 

Alongside academic writing, I engage in public scholarship, book reviews, and collaborative projects that bridge theory and practice. 

I am a PhD student at University of Colorado boulder, you can find more about it here:
