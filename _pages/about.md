I am a human geographer working at the intersection of urban studies, political economy, and development geography theory. My research examines displacement, land, and urban redevelopment in Bengaluru, India, asking how marginalized communities contest and rework the city through everyday practices of repair—legal, ecological, and infrastructural.

I am interested in how do people inhabit and remake urban space. Drawing on urban political economy, economic and development geography, and southern urban theory, I trace how concepts like state, market, land, and citizenship are lived and negotiated realities. I am more and more  interested in incremental construction, and ecological stewardship become insurgent forms of city-making.

Methodologically, I combine ethnography, archival research, and legal analysis. I treat infrastructure not only as an object of study but as a method for understanding relations between residents, the state, and capital.

Alongside academic writing, I engage in public scholarship, book reviews, and collaborative projects that bridge theory and practice. 

I am a PhD student at University of Colorado boulder, you can find more about it here:
