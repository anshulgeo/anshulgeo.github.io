An essay reflecting on the enduring political and moral legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., exploring how his conception of shared ethical responsibility and collective moral agency can inform responses to contemporary crises of inequality, social division, and moral fatigue. Drawing on King’s speeches and historical experiences, this piece situates his thought within both U.S. civic struggles and broader global contexts. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
